		The city was occupied by the Soviets in 1979 but they too abandoned it after the 1988 Geneva Accords were signed. 
		A civil war in the 1990s between various rebel groups destroyed much of the city, resulting in many casualties.
		Since the removal of the Taliban from power in late 2001, the city gradually began rebuilding itself with assistance by the international community. 
		Despite the many terrorist attacks by anti-state elements, the city is growing and developing. 
		The city is divided into about 18 districts.

		<h2 id="B"> Bamiyan </h2>
		<p> Bamyian is a historic city in the centre of afghanistan with wide mountain ranges and beautiful valleys. </p>
		<p> The Budhas of Bamiyan being one of the most famous landmarks of the city, has come to be a beautiful historic and tourist attraction site. 
		This cut out Budha in the central valley of bamyian is one fo the largest cut out budha in the wrold. This landmark marks the strong belief in buddhism back in the 6th and 7th century. 
		The two monuments located on the east and west side of the valley are carved into the mountain. The first of these monuments being 175 feet in height and the second approximately 120 feet. 
		Both budhas seems to have indian culture or some greek cultural origin since they were described to have robes on and have had curly hair carved.
		They have mostly been bombarded in the recent years due to the wars occuring in Afghanistan and it being a islamic country did not encourage the practice of worshipping the monuments. 
		These budhas were distructed mostly by Mullah omar and his taliban forces in 2001 and justified this act as the sculture were bound to be destroyed since bamyian has been an islamic countries for many centuries now. 
		Only a few details of the buddhas remain and rebuilding or reconstruction of it would be nearly imposssible as nearly all the original pictures or portraits of the buddahs has been destroyed. </p>
